<h3 data-number="1.1"
id="derivatives-conceptual-foundations-and-procedural-mastery-university-freshman"><span
class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Derivatives: Conceptual
Foundations and Procedural Mastery (University Freshman)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Topic</strong>: Differentiation techniques in
single-variable calculus.</li>
<li><strong>Goals</strong>: Build both conceptual understanding and
procedural fluency in taking derivatives of algebraic, exponential,
logarithmic, and trigonometric functions.</li>
<li><strong>Strategy</strong>:
<ul>
<li>Begin with a concise summary of derivative rules using
theorem-format tables to support memorization and quick reference.</li>
<li>Use scaffolded examples starting from power rules to chain rule
applications, gradually increasing in complexity.</li>
<li>Mix symbolic computation with contextual word problems and
limit-based definitions to reinforce deeper understanding.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Materials</strong>: LaTeX-typed handout.</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-number="1.2"
id="series-a-modeling-approach-to-arithmetic-and-geometric-series-grade-8-uk-curriculum"><span
class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Series: A Modeling Approach to
Arithmetic and Geometric Series (Grade 8, UK Curriculum)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Topic</strong>: Arithmetic and geometric series.</li>
<li><strong>Goals</strong>: Introduce and derive series formulas through
contextual modeling.</li>
<li><strong>Strategy</strong>: Use salary growth and paper-folding
problems to motivate modeling, then derive formulas algebraically;
later, extend to infinite geometric series using the concept of
limits.</li>
<li><strong>Materials</strong>: Typst-typed handout.</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-number="1.3"
id="quadratic-equations-solving-equations-visualization-grade-8-uk-curriculum"><span
class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Quadratic Equations: Solving
Equations &amp; Visualization (Grade 8, UK Curriculum)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Topic</strong>: Solving quadratic equations.</li>
<li><strong>Goals</strong>: Develop students’ understanding of how
factorized forms relate to polynomial graphs and the role of
multiplicity; connect algebraic roots with graph intersections.</li>
<li><strong>Strategy</strong>: Combine factorization, sign analysis, and
visual graph features to help students build intuition about root
behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Materials</strong>: Typst-typed handout and GeoGebra.</li>
</ul>
<h2 data-number="2" id="teaching-tools-and-approach"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Teaching Tools and Approach</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Student Profiles</strong>: Experience tutoring a Taiwanese
high school student, a UK curriculum students (Grade 8), and early
undergraduates; sensitive to diverse learner backgrounds and learning
paces.</li>
<li><strong>Pedagogy</strong>: Prioritize sense-making over drill;
integrate “why” before “how”; draw connections across mathematics and
logic.</li>
<li><strong>Assessment</strong>: Use formative checks and tailored
challenge problems to assess depth of understanding.</li>
<li><strong>Customization</strong>: Each material is tailored to the
learner’s pace, background, and curriculum.</li>
<li><strong>Languages</strong>: Designed for bilingual instruction (I
can explain in both Mandarin and English); basic explanations available
in French or Japanese if needed.</li>
<li><strong>Technical Authoring</strong>: Skilled in Typst and LaTeX for
high-quality mathematical typesetting and custom worksheet
creation.</li>
<li><strong>Delivery Modes</strong>: Comfortable designing for online,
hybrid, and in-person instruction; experienced in remote tutoring across
time zones.</li>
</ul>
<h2 data-number="3" id="teaching-philosophy-design-principles"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> Teaching Philosophy &amp; Design
Principles</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Interdisciplinary</strong>: Link mathematics with economics
or physics to cultivate real-world relevance.</li>
<li><strong>Concept-first</strong>: Prioritize intuitive understanding
before formal manipulation.</li>
<li><strong>Global-ready</strong>: Design materials for international
learners with linguistic adaptability.</li>
<li><strong>Equity-aware</strong>: Scaffold content for students with
diverse mathematics backgrounds and language proficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Reflective Practice</strong>: Revise materials based on
student feedback and observed misconceptions.</li>
</ul>
