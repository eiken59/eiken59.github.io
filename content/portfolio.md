## Selected Teaching Plans

Designed for 1-on-1 tutoring (adaptable for classroom or small-group settings)

### Derivatives: Conceptual Foundations and Procedural Mastery (University Freshman)

- **Topic**: Differentiation techniques in single-variable calculus.
- **Goals**: Build both conceptual understanding and procedural fluency in taking derivatives of algebraic, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions.
- **Strategy**:
    - Begin with a concise summary of derivative rules using theorem-format tables to support memorization and quick reference.
    - Use scaffolded examples starting from power rules to chain rule applications, gradually increasing in complexity.
    - Mix symbolic computation with contextual word problems and limit-based definitions to reinforce deeper understanding.
- **Materials**: LaTeX-typed handout.

### Series: A Modeling Approach to Arithmetic and Geometric Series (Grade 8, UK Curriculum)

- **Topic**: Arithmetic and geometric series.
- **Goals**: Introduce and derive series formulas through contextual modeling.
- **Strategy**: Use salary growth and paper-folding problems to motivate modeling, then derive formulas algebraically; later, extend to infinite geometric series using the concept of limits.
- **Materials**: Typst-typed handout.

### Quadratic Equations: Solving Equations & Visualization (Grade 8, UK Curriculum)

- **Topic**: Solving quadratic equations.
- **Goals**: Develop students' understanding of how factorized forms relate to polynomial graphs and the role of multiplicity; connect algebraic roots with graph intersections.
- **Strategy**: Combine factorization, sign analysis, and visual graph features to help students build intuition about root behavior.
- **Materials**: Typst-typed handout and GeoGebra. 

## Teaching Tools and Approach

- **Student Profiles**: Experience tutoring a Taiwanese high school student, a UK curriculum students (Grade 8), and early undergraduates; sensitive to diverse learner backgrounds and learning paces.
- **Pedagogy**: Prioritize sense-making over drill; integrate "why" before "how"; draw connections across mathematics and logic.
- **Assessment**: Use formative checks and tailored challenge problems to assess depth of understanding.
- **Customization**: Each material is tailored to the learner's pace, background, and curriculum.
- **Languages**: Designed for bilingual instruction (I can explain in both Mandarin and English); basic explanations available in French or Japanese if needed.
- **Technical Authoring**: Skilled in Typst and LaTeX for high-quality mathematical typesetting and custom worksheet creation.
- **Delivery Modes**: Comfortable designing for online, hybrid, and in-person instruction; experienced in remote tutoring across time zones.

## Teaching Philosophy & Design Principles

- **Interdisciplinary**: Link mathematics with economics or physics to cultivate real-world relevance.
- **Concept-first**: Prioritize intuitive understanding before formal manipulation.
- **Global-ready**: Design materials for international learners with linguistic adaptability.
- **Equity-aware**: Scaffold content for students with diverse mathematics backgrounds and language proficiency.
- **Reflective Practice**: Revise materials based on student feedback and observed misconceptions.
