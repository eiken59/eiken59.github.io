## 2024 Fall (exchange at X)

I took 16 ECTS this semester.

| Course Name | Teacher | ECTS | Score |
| --- | --- | :---: | :---: |
| Algorithms for Discrete Mathematics | Lucas GERIN | 3 | A |
| Object-oriented Programming | Gaël THOMAS & Julien TIERNY | 5 | A- |
| Macroeconomics | Mehdi SENOUCI & Gauthier VERMANDEL | 5 | B+ |
| Beginner French | Alexia BRUILLON | 2 | A+ |
| Sports - Year 2 (Climbing) | | 1 | A |

### Algorithms for Discrete Mathematics
The course curriculum is meticulously designed, requiring minimal coursework aside from a capstone project—for which ample class time is allocated. It provides a comprehensive introduction to `NumPy`, `SymPy`, and `SciPy`. The instructor possesses a sharp intellect and a distinctive, mathematician-centric sense of humor.

### Object-oriented Programming
I was surprised to find that BX students commence their C++ journey with this course. At NYCU, Object-Oriented Programming succeeds Introduction to Computer Science, presupposing familiarity with C++. Having acquired most of the foundational concepts during my freshman year under Professor CHEN, I found the curriculum familiar. The final project, involving the development of a chess bot, was engaging. I must acknowledge the substantial contribution of Jetz, a BX student, who played a pivotal role in our success.

### Macroeconomics
This course proved to be my academic nadir in France. Lacking prerequisite coursework in economics, I found the material unexpectedly rigorous. While the fundamental concepts initially appeared straightforward—and the instructors elucidated them with clarity—translating that understanding into successful examination responses proved elusive. Perhaps this inscrutability is the very essence of economics.


### Beginner French
The instructor was exceptionally amiable, cultivating a remarkably relaxed atmosphere. The Tuesday afternoon sessions were consistently enjoyable and fostered a genuine sense of camaraderie among the class.

### Sports - Year 2 (Climbing)
Attendance alone suffices for a passing grade, irrespective of active participation. However, I found the climbing itself genuinely compelling. It also served as an excellent venue for practicing French conversation, despite the instructor's proficiency in English. I learned the colloquialism "avoir les bouteilles" (referring to the sensation of having forearms as hard as bottles), describing the muscle pump experienced after intense exertion.

## 2025 Spring (exchange at X)

I took 16 ECTS this semester.

| Course Name | Teacher | ECTS | Score |
| --- | --- | :---: | :---: |
| History of Economics | Béatrice CHERRIER | 3 | A |
| Machine Learning | Jesse READ | 5 | A |
| Econometrics | Laura RECUERO VIRTO & Arne UHLENDORFF | 5 | A |
| Intermediate French (B1/B2) | Marie-Chantal GERARD | 2 | A |
| Sports - Year 2 (Recketlon) | | 1 | A+ |

### History of Economics
This course stands as the zenith of my academic experience thus far. Initially, the role-playing debates—requiring participation as both actors and audience—were a source of significant stress. However, the curriculum was instrumental in refining my critical thinking and rhetorical timing. The debate training effectively compensated for the lack of formal instruction on academic writing, offering practical insights that transcended mere composition definitions.

### Machine Learning
A standard Machine Learning curriculum utilizing `Python`. The final project is relatively low-stress, requiring a presentation of slides and interpretation of results rather than a detailed code review.

### Econometrics
Whether due to my background in Applied Mathematics or otherwise, I found the content quite accessible. The first three-quarters of the semester focused on OLS, followed by introductions to panel data, cross-sectional data, and time series analysis. The practical sessions (TDs)—with special acknowledgement to TA PIERRE—and R assignments were incredibly beneficial, provided one followed the instructions rigorously.

While the latter part of the semester covered a broad spectrum of topics, the examination focused primarily on conceptual understanding, which was both fair and appropriate.

### Intermediate French (B1/B2)
No comments.

### Sports - Year 2 (Recketlon)
Approximately 30 students share a large indoor facility (comprising eight badminton courts), with outdoor tennis courts also available. Attendance is sufficient to pass, though the instructors actively encourage physical engagement.

## 2025 Summer

| Course Name | Teacher | 老師 | Credits | Score |
| --- | --- | --- | :---: | :---: |
| Accounting (I) | TSAI Bi-Huei | 蔡璧徽 | 3 | A+ |

### Accounting (I)
Typical of Professor TSAI's courses, the workload is manageable with minimal homework. Examination questions are disclosed in advance, and attendance is emphasized.

## 2025 Fall

I took 18 credits this semester. My GPA was 4.05.

| Course Name | Teacher | 老師 | Credits | Score |
| --- | --- | --- | :---: | :---: |
| Algebra (I) | KANG Ming-Hsuan | 康明軒 | 3 | A |
| Softball | HUANG Shan-Ying | 黃杉楹 | 0 | A+ |

| Financial Management | TSAI Bi-Huei | 蔡璧徽 | 3 | A+ |
| Futures and Options | LEE Han-Hsing | 李漢星 | 3 | A- |

### Algebra (I)
Special acknowledgement is due to the Teaching Assistant for the recitation sessions; his support was invaluable.

The examinations are challenging, yet the instructor mitigates this by reviewing past papers prior to the exam dates.

The course content is rigorous, and the pedagogical style strikes a balance between interactivity and formal mathematical precision, supported by ample examples.

### Softball
Attendance constitutes 40% of the grade. Full attendance guarantees a passing grade.

### Directed Individual Study (I)
I conducted research on the gambler's ruin problem this semester, utilizing the text by Lawler and Limic. Following the presentation within my home department, I was invited to present at NTHU, where I was honored with the Best Presentation Award.

### Advanced Statistics
The pacing is leisurely, with a relatively light curriculum coverage.
*   **Grading**: Midterm, Take-home Final.
*   **Comments**: No attendance requirements or homework assignments.

### Machine Learning
As is characteristic of Professor LIN, the instruction facilitates efficient knowledge absorption. The pace is rigorous yet productive. Concepts are intricately interwoven, creating a mesmerizing intellectual flow.

Assessment comprises homework (approximately 80%) and a final project (approximately 20%). The assignments are straightforward given sufficient dedication, while the final project demands meticulous design and originality to distinguish one's work from peers.

### Financial Management
Typical of Professor TSAI's courses, the workload is light with minimal homework. Exam questions are previewed in advance, and attendance is required.

The report does not demand extensive content; rather, it requires pinpointing the most salient aspect of your chosen article or event-study research.

### Futures and Options
This course presented the most significant struggle. It crystallized my decision to avoid the investment track in my future career.

The instructor, holding a bachelor's degree in mathematics, demonstrated remarkable eloquence when elucidating complex concepts—a testament to his background. However, I lack the aptitude for finance or trading. While I appreciate his pedagogical approach, I suspect the difficulty lay in my own limitations with the subject matter.

## 2026 Spring

I will take 9 credits this semester.
